    "bio": "I was working on our front-end EmberJS codebase back in 2014, and beginning to toy with ReactJS. Given I've not touched Javascript since 2005, EmberJS and ReactJS did not feel right at home for me. Then Redux came along, and that was when I found elm-lang which did everything that React+Redux provided, with a friendly compiler, less boiler-plate code, and the safety of no runtime ever once it compiles."
