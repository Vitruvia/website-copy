This policy was adopted from the Front-end London Slack community.

The details:

Exercism should be a safe place for everybody regardless of
- gender, gender identity or gender expression

These things are NOT OK.

Be aware of how your actions affect others. If it makes someone uncomfortable, stop.

If you say something that is found offensive, and you are called out on it, let’s:

- Listen without interruption.
- Believe what the person is saying & do not attempt to disqualify what they have to say.
- Ask for tips / help with avoiding making the offence in the future.
- Apologise and ask forgiveness.
- Failing to follow the Code of Conduct as described in this document carries consequences. For minor infractions, you may be temporarily suspended from using Exercism. Upon repeat offenses, or if the community believes you are not acting in good faith, you may be asked to leave permanently.

If you experience abuse, harassment, discrimination, or feel unsafe, email abuse@exercism.io.
